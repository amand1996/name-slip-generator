# name-slip-generator

This application generates name slips using JSON data from a database or an excel sheet. It uses Embedded Javascript (EJS) for generation. This application is of great use when we need to generate name slips for a large number of people (say more than 1000). In such a situation, it would be really difficult to make all the name slips manually. So, we can take use of ejs templating engine.
